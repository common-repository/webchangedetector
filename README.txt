## The #1 Visual Regression Test Tool For WordPress

Check your website visually after **WP auto updates** to see if something broke with visual regression tests. Or monitor your website visually in intervals and get notified about any change.
With WebChange Detector you can find any difference on your website

*   after installing updates,
*   after installing new plugins,
*   after pagespeed optimization,
*   after CSS changes or
*   any other customization on your WordPress website.

See all differences **highlighted in a new screenshot** to easily compare your website before and after the changes.
With our visual regression tests for WordPress you can make sure your website looks like it should, and fix anything which looks wrong, before your visitors see the issues.
